The wheel portrays the cycle of creation, preservation and release and signifies the movement in life across time and space, The wheel thus stands for continuity as well as change and implies the continuous striving of NSS for social change.</p></div></div></div><section class="team-boxed"></section><script src="../file/b/js/b.js?h=06ed58a0080308e1635633c2fd9a56a3"></script><script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/baguettebox.js/1.10.0/baguetteBox.min.js"></script><script src="../file/js/script.min.js?h=871eaf34490f6ede138d4310d8a62bd3"></script></body></html>
